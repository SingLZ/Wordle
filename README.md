## Notes

I recently started using Swift for the first time, and while it's a new programming language to me, my previous experience with other programming languages has been incredibly beneficial. Having a foundation in languages like Python and Java allowed me to quickly grasp Swift's syntax and concepts. It's fascinating to see how my understanding of programming principles seamlessly translates across languages, making the learning curve for Swift smoother than I initially expected. While I'm still getting the hang of Swift's unique features and quirks, my prior coding experience has proven to be a valuable asset in this exciting journey of mastering a new language.

## Notes

I felt like this second part was more simple than the first part since most of the codes was very similar in all the exercises. There was still some misunderstandings, but I manages to get through most of them and the hints were very helpful.
